Designing a shallow neural network and a linearly separable dataset , using Relu activation , ADAM optimizer , one Hot encoding labels and cross entropy loss fucntion.
The model is based on Tensorflow.
The inferences are calculated on the basis of Epoch vs Error Graph , Confusion Matrix .
I also create decision plots of three classes
